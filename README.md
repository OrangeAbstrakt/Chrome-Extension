 ####  It is Simple
 ####  It is organised
 ####  It doesnt take up any of the space on your screen
 ####  It looks sick...
 
 #### If You use chrome, You know about the shortcuts on the home page and you might be wondering how this is helpful to you...
 #### well for starters the shortcuts on the home page are limited to just 10. Where as SuperCuts provides a total of 30 shortcuts.
 #### Now most people would think about the bookmarks bar. But here are the reasons this extension is better than the bar
 
 #### The bookamrks bar takes up space on your screen.
 #### Whereas SuperCuts only popups up when you want it to.
 #### once the number of bookmarks reaches a certain number they are put in a dropdown which is less organised than the code i write before breakfast...
 
#### So simply put Supercuts offers more shortcuts which can be organsised better. Hence the name SuperCuts.

## How to Use It:

#### This is what the extension looks like:

#### To Add a link simply click the plus sign.
